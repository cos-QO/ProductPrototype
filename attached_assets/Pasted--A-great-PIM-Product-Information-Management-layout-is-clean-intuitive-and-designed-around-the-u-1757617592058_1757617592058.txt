
A great PIM (Product Information Management) layout is clean, intuitive, and designed around the user's workflow. The main goal is to efficiently centralize, enrich, and distribute accurate product data. While specific layouts differ between PIM providers, here is a breakdown of common features and best practices for an optimal user interface. 
The PIM dashboard
A PIM's main dashboard serves as the operational hub, giving users an at-a-glance overview of product data health and progress. 
Key metrics: Displays KPIs like percentage of products with complete information, number of products awaiting approval, or enrichment progress per channel.
Quick search and filtering: A prominent search bar and a set of filters (by category, status, brand, etc.) help users quickly find specific products or groups.
Task lists: Shows tasks requiring attention, such as products missing key information, or items in a specific step of the workflow.
User activity: Offers a feed of recent activity and product updates, which is particularly useful for collaborative teams. 
The product details page
This is the core of any PIM, where product information is centralized and enriched. An effective product detail page is structured logically with sections that match a user's workflow. 
Header
Product identity: Shows the main product name, SKU, and status (e.g., "Draft," "In Review," "Published").
Action buttons: Quick access to essential functions like "Save," "Publish," "Request Approval," or "Translate."
Breadcrumbs: Helps the user orient themselves within the product hierarchy (e.g., Electronics > Laptops > Apple MacBook Air). 
Tabbed navigation
To prevent information overload, all of a product's data is organized into logical tabs. 
General: Basic product details, including name, description, brand, and unique product identifiers.
Attributes/Specifications: A dedicated section for editing product attributes, organized by logical groups (e.g., "Technical Specs," "Materials," "Dimensions").
Media: Manages all digital assets for the product (images, videos, documents) with an integrated Digital Asset Management (DAM) system. This section should support multiple versions and provide image editing and cropping tools.
SEO: Optimizes the product for search engines with fields for metadata, URLs, keywords, and channel-specific data.
Variants: If applicable, this tab allows for managing variations of a product (e.g., color, size, material) within a single parent item.
Channels: Shows the publishing status of the product across different sales channels (e.g., website, Amazon, print catalog).
History: A full audit trail of changes made to the product, including who made them and when, ensures data integrity. 
Data enrichment interface
An intuitive PIM provides streamlined tools for filling out product data and ensuring its quality.
Bulk editing: Allows users to select multiple products and update attributes in a single action, which is invaluable for large catalogs.
Validation rules: Displays progress bars and alerts to notify users of missing or non-compliant information, ensuring all fields are complete before a product can be published.
Workflow management: Shows which enrichment steps are completed and who is responsible for the next action. This helps multiple users collaborate without confusion. 
Collaborative and localization features
For teams in different departments or regions, a PIM facilitates collaboration and localization.
Roles and permissions: The layout reflects a user's access rights, ensuring that the marketing team sees content fields while the e-commerce manager sees channel publishing options.
Comment functionality: Allows team members to leave notes on a product, providing context or requesting additional information.
Localization view: An interface for managing product data in different languages and for various regional markets. 
Workflow and automation interface
A great PIM layout provides clear visibility into automated processes and workflows.
Kanban-style workflows: A card-based view can help teams visualize and manage products as they move through the enrichment and approval process.
Integration status: Shows the connection status with other business systems, such as ERP or e-commerce platforms, and alerts users to any data synchronization issues.
