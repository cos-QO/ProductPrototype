4. Data Architecture Requirements
Database Models

A retailer links to an existing SKU and adds custom imagery for their audience.
UC-3
Product Bundle Creation
A merchandiser creates a bundle of 3 SKUs into a single product family (e.g., a “Living Room Set”).
UC-4
API Syndication
A partner marketplace pulls enriched product data via API for display.


6. Success Metrics
✅ 100% of products registered with structured metadata


✅ <24-hour average time-to-market for new SKUs


✅ 90% reduction in duplicate SKUs across retailers
