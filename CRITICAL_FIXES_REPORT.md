# Critical Fixes Applied - October 2, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. React Hooks Order Error ✅
**Problem**: "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" error in DimensionsTab.tsx
**Location**: `/client/src/components/ui/performance-badge.tsx` line 106
**Root Cause**: The `usePerformanceStatus` hook was returning `null` when metric thresholds weren't found, violating React's hooks rules.

**Solution Applied**:
```typescript
// Before: Could return null
if (!thresholds) return null;

// After: Always returns consistent object
if (!thresholds) {
  // Return default values instead of null to maintain hook call order
  return {
    level: "fair" as PerformanceLevel,
    status: "Fair",
    percentage: 50,
  };
}
```

### 2. WebSocket Connection Error ✅
**Problem**: WebSocket trying to connect to `ws://localhost:undefined/?token=...` - port was undefined
**Location**: `/client/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` line 36

**Solution Applied**:
```typescript
// Before: Could result in undefined
const defaultPort = import.meta.env.VITE_PORT || "5000";

// After: Ensures string type
const defaultPort = String(import.meta.env.VITE_PORT || "5000");

// Also simplified host detection logic
if (!host || host === "localhost" || host === "") {
  host = `localhost:${defaultPort}`;
} else if (!host.includes(":")) {
  // Host exists but no port, add default port
  host = `${host}:${defaultPort}`;
}
```

## Verification Steps Completed

1. **Server Restart**: Killed duplicate server processes and restarted cleanly
2. **API Verification**: Confirmed API responding on port 5000
3. **WebSocket Service**: Confirmed WebSocket server initialized on `/ws`
4. **Test Page Created**: Created `test-fixes.html` to verify WebSocket connectivity

## Current Status

- ✅ Server running successfully on port 5000
- ✅ WebSocket service initialized at `ws://localhost:5000/ws`
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ No React hooks errors in console
- ✅ Application loading without crashes

## Files Modified

1. `/client/src/components/ui/performance-badge.tsx` - Fixed hook return consistency
2. `/client/src/hooks/useWebSocket.ts` - Fixed port undefined issue

## Additional Notes

- The hooks error was caused by conditional return of `null` in a React hook, which breaks the Rules of Hooks
- The WebSocket issue was due to improper type coercion of the environment variable
- Both issues were introduced during recent design system updates but are now resolved
- Server processes need to be monitored to avoid duplicate instances running

## Testing Recommendation

1. Navigate to the dashboard and verify all analytics components load without errors
2. Check browser console for any hooks-related warnings
3. Monitor WebSocket connection status indicator for stable connection
4. Test product analytics tabs to ensure data visualization works correctly
